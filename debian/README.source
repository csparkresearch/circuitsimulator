circuitsimulator for Debian
--------------------------

The source of the package is maintained at 
https://github.com/csparkresearch/circuitsimulator ; this repository is
essentially a fork of https://github.com/SEVA77/circuitjs1, with some changes:

- all code related to AVR8 is removed
- the file war/lz-string.js is downloaded from
  https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string
